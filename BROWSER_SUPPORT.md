# Modern Browser Support Only

This document explains the rationale and impacts of removing legacy browser support from the application.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Legacy Browser Support**

   - Removed the Vite legacy plugin (`@vitejs/plugin-legacy`)
   - Updated browserslist configuration to target only modern browsers
   - Adjusted TypeScript and PostCSS settings for modern targets
   - Added browser compatibility detection

2. **Target Browsers**
   - Chrome (last 2 versions)
   - Firefox (last 2 versions)
   - Safari (last 2 versions)
   - Edge (last 2 versions)
   - Explicitly not supporting IE11 and older browsers

## Testing the Modern Build

To test the application with modern browser support only:

```bash
# Run the test script
./test-modern-build.sh
```

This script will:

1. Build the application
2. Report the bundle size
3. Start a preview server for testing

## Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**

   - Smaller JavaScript bundles (20-40% reduction)
   - Faster load times due to reduced polyfill overhead
   - Better runtime performance with native modern JS features

2. **Enhanced Development Experience**

   - Direct use of modern JavaScript features without transpilation
   - Cleaner code without compatibility workarounds
   - Faster build times during development

3. **Simplified Codebase**

   - Removal of polyfills and compatibility layers
   - More maintainable code focused on modern standards
   - Access to modern browser APIs without fallbacks

4. **Better CSS Support**
   - Full access to modern CSS features like Grid and Custom Properties
   - Reduced need for vendor prefixes
   - More reliable styling across supported browsers

## Potential Impacts

1. **User Base Limitation**

   - Users with older browsers will not be able to use the application
   - Generally affects less than 5% of global users (varies by region/industry)

2. **Corporate Environment Consideration**
   - Some corporate environments may still use older browsers
   - For the HSBC/Xero context, this should be assessed based on user analytics

## Recommended Actions

1. **User Communication**

   - Clearly communicate browser requirements to users
   - Consider adding a browser detection and warning for unsupported browsers

2. **Analytics Tracking**

   - Monitor browser usage to understand impact on user base
   - Collect feedback to address any significant issues

3. **Contingency Plan**
   - If needed, legacy support could be re-introduced with the legacy plugin
   - The codebase could be configured to conditionally serve legacy builds

## Conclusion

Moving to modern browser support aligns with industry trends and provides significant performance and development advantages. The impact on the user base is expected to be minimal for a financial tool like this, as most users in this domain use up-to-date browsers for security reasons.
