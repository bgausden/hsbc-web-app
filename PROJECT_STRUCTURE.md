# Project Structure Reorganization

The project has been reorganized to follow a feature-based structure that aligns with industry best practices. Below is a summary of the changes made and next steps.

## Changes Made

1. **Reorganized Directory Structure**

   - Implemented a feature-based structure with clear separation of concerns
   - Moved utilities to core/utils directory
   - Grouped related functionality in feature directories
   - Created dedicated UI components directory
   - Restructured SCSS files
   - Co-located tests with their corresponding features

2. **Code Improvements**

   - Added proper TypeScript interfaces
   - Improved function documentation
   - Enhanced code organization and modularity
   - Created logical boundaries between different parts of the application

3. **Build and Development**
   - Updated package.json scripts
   - Added helper scripts for development and build
   - Maintained compatibility with existing Vite setup

## Next Steps

1. **Clean Up Old Files**

   - Run `./cleanup-migration.sh` to move old files to a backup directory
   - After testing, old files can be safely deleted

2. **Development**

   - Run `./start-dev.sh` to start the development server
   - The application will be available at http://localhost:5173

3. **Build for Production**

   - Run `./build-prod.sh` to create a production build
   - Production files will be in the dist/ directory

4. **Testing**
   - Tests are now co-located with features
   - Run `npm test` to run all tests
   - Run `npm run test:watch` for development with test watching
   - Run `npm run test:coverage` to get test coverage reports

## Benefits of the New Structure

- **Maintainability**: Related code is grouped together making it easier to maintain
- **Discoverability**: Clear directory structure makes it easier to find code
- **Scalability**: Can easily add new features or enhance existing ones
- **Testability**: Co-located tests make it easier to maintain test coverage
- **Onboarding**: New developers can more easily understand the codebase

If you encounter any issues with the new structure, you can refer to the backup files in `.old_src_backup/` for reference.
